# ImageProcessing-TicTacToe

# Introduction

There was a tast at Microsoft challenge about image processing and I decided to dig into this
for fun and try to recognize object in the picture. I never worked with image processing
before, so I was quite curious, how those things worked. Happy to be part of it!
